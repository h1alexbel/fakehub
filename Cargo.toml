GitHub API Server Stub.
There are many applications that use GitHub API for different purposes.
All of them need to create automated tests, which need to mock the API server somehow.
Would be nice to have a fully functioning mock version of a GitHub API, which would support all functions,
but work locally, with absolutely no connection to GitHub.
