# Fakehub Server

Server is a fully runnable instance of fakehub, served through HTTP. Server
consists of three main layers:

* Web layer backed by [Axum].
* Object layer, where we operate on mock versions of
[GitHub objects][GitHub API], generated by [github-mirror](/github-mirror).
* Storage layer, where we store and query objects as in memory data structures,
like arrays, and hashmaps.

To test it, run this (make sure you are in `/server` directory):

```bash
cargo test
```
