    to name Git branches the way you named this one: "`chore-contribution-vitals`".
    You''ve earned -10 points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as
    the number of the ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for
    example, would be "`96`". Your running balance is +50. '
