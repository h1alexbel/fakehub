    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request

  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Great job on your contribution! You've earned +4
    points, which is our base reward. Your 103 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)

    We bumped it up by 15 to keep you motivated. Your balance is now [+16](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/fakehub/zerocracy/fakehub-vitals.html).
    Remember, code reviews and comments are crucial for quality. [Keep the contributions
    coming](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html), and aim for
    that sweet spot of 200-800 hits-of-code for max points next time!"

  details: It's time to punish @h1alexbel for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in h1alexbel/fakehub, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
