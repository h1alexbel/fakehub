  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Great job on your contribution! You've earned +4
    points, which is our base reward. Your 103 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)
    added +5 points, but we had to deduct 16 for no code review and 4 for only 3 comments.
    We bumped it up by 15 to keep you motivated. Your balance is now [+16](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/fakehub/zerocracy/fakehub-vitals.html).
    Remember, code reviews and comments are crucial for quality. [Keep the contributions
    coming](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html), and aim for
    that sweet spot of 200-800 hits-of-code for max points next time!"

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @h1alexbel for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in h1alexbel/fakehub, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [+47](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/fakehub/zerocracy/fakehub-vitals.html). '

  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Thanks for your code review! While it was a bit
    short (only 2 hits-of-code), we appreciate your effort. You earned 4 points as
    a base, but we had to deduct some due to the low code volume and only 4 comments.
    To keep you motivated, we bumped it up to +4 points total. Remember, more code
    and comments can lead to bigger bonuses next time! Your current balance is [+39](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/fakehub/zerocracy/fakehub-vitals.html).
    Keep up the good work! \U0001F4AA\n\n<!-- Thanks for the review! You've earned
    +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -10 for very few (4) comments; -8 for too few
    (2) hits-of-code; +18 to give you at least something.  Your running balance is
    [+39](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/fakehub/zerocracy/fakehub-vitals.html).  -->"

  greeting: |-
    Thanks for your contribution! Your reward is +4 points, calculated as follows: +4 base, -16 for no code review, -4 for insufficient comments (only 1), and +20 to meet the minimum. While this isn't ideal, remember that [quality and speed](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) are both crucial. For future contributions, ensure you get a code review and encourage more comments to maximize your points. Your current balance stands at [+51](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/fakehub/zerocracy/fakehub-vitals.html). Keep up the good work!

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -16 for the lack of code review; -4 for very few (1) comments; +20 to give you at least something. Please, [keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) them coming. Your running balance is [+51](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/fakehub/zerocracy/fakehub-vitals.html).  -->

  details: It's time to punish @h1alexbel for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in h1alexbel/fakehub, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).

    the reward amount is 4.
  greeting: "Thanks for your code review! Here's how your +4 points were calculated:
    +4 base points, -24 for self-review, +0.02 for 2 hits-of-code, -16 for no comments,
    -8 for < 16 hits-of-code, and +48 to meet the minimum 4-point reward. Your balance
    is now [+55](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/fakehub/zerocracy/fakehub-vitals.html).
    Keep up the good work and aim for more comments and hits-of-code next time! \U0001F4BB\n\n<!--
    Thanks for the review! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -10 for
    very few (4) comments; -8 for too few (2) hits-of-code; +18 to give you at least
    something.  Your running balance is [+55](https://www.h1alexbel.xyz/fakehub/zerocracy/fakehub-vitals.html).
